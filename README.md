# Recognition of bitmapped alphanumeric characters using machine learning and neural network algorithms
 
The sole purpose of this project is to create and train neural network based algorithm to be able to recognize alphanumerical characters on two-dimensional bitmap. Computer program is supposed to be written in Python 3.0 language, using object-oriented approach and graphical user interface. This project will also contain thorough mathematical model coverage of a given problem, as well as complete documentation for users and developers.
